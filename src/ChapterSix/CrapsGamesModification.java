//6.33 (Craps Game Modification) Modify the craps program of Fig. 6.8 to allow wagering. Ini-
//        tialize variable bankBalance to 1000 dollars. Prompt the player to enter a wager . Check that wager
//        is less than or equal to bankBalance , and if it’s not, have the user reenter wager until a valid wager
//        is entered. Then, run one game of craps. If the player wins, increase bankBalance by wager and dis-
//        play the new bankBalance . If the player loses, decrease bankBalance by wager , display the new bank-
//        Balance , check whether bankBalance has become zero and, if so, display the message "Sorry. You
//        busted!" As the game progresses, display various messages to create some “chatter,” such as "Oh,
//        you're going for broke, huh?" or "Aw c'mon, take a chance!" or "You're up big. Now's the time
//        to cash in your chips!".
//        Implement the “chatter” as a separate method that randomly chooses the
//        string to display.

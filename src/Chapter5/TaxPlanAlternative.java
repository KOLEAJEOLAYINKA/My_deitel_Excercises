//.32 (Tax Plan Alternatives; The “FairTax”) There are many proposals to make taxation fairer.
//        Check out the FairTax initiative in the United States at http://www.fairtax.org . Research how
//        the proposed FairTax works. One suggestion is to eliminate income taxes and most other taxes in
//        favor of a 23% consumption tax on all products and services that you buy. Some FairTax opponents
//        question the 23% figure and say that because of the way the tax is calculated, it would be more ac-
//        curate to say the rate is 30%—check this carefully. Write a program that prompts the user to enter
//        expenses in various expense categories they have (e.g., housing, food, clothing, transportation, edu-
//        cation, health care, vacations), then prints the estimated FairTax that person would pay.
